 <p style="text-align:center;"> There have been many major events that have happend in my life so far some postive and negative. One negative event this year was when my aunt died. She had a very bad disease and she fought it for a long time and it was sad when she passed but it was for the better generally speaking becasue she was in so much pain.</p>
