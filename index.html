<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Year in review </h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Important events this year</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"> This year has been a great year for me so far. Here I am going to talk about major events this year that have had a big impact on me and my family. Also, I know that this year has been very tough for a lot of families due to the whole COVID-19 situation in terms of losing jobs, less money coming in etc... I am very lucky and grateful that my family is in a good place amidst all of this. My best wishes go out to all of the struggling families out there.</p>
