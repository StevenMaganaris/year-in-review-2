 <h1 style="text-align:center;">Big and major events that have had impacts on me this year</h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> There have been many major events that have happend in my life so far some postive and negative. One negative event this year was when my aunt died. She had a very bad disease and she fought it for a long time and it was sad when she passed but it was for the better generally speaking becasue she was in so much pain. Another negative was of course, this whole COVID-19 thing. What sucks about it was that the baseball season got cancled that I was very exited for. We did get to play 3 games, but I wish we could have played a full season. <br><br> A couple postives were that I started flying lessons this year. One thing that I really want to do when I grow up is I want to become a piolt and the first step is taking begginer lessons but it is a lot to comprehend. Another postive is that my sister who has been living in santa barbra, comes up to see me, my dad, and more more which is very exiting and I enjoy seeing her. </p>
